Fecundity relationships (CTmax and size)

#| fig.cap = "CAPTION HERE."

knitr::include_graphics("../Output/Figures/markdown/main-fig-fecundity-plots-1.png") #Use this when filling in figures from analysis 
```

```{r, table, echo = F}
knitr::kable(x = 1, #Replace 1 with whatever object you want included as a table
      digits = 3, align = "c",
      caption = "CAPTION HERE")
```

# Discussion

Acclimation affects natural populations over seasonal timescales

Effects are shaped by trade-off with limits (as observed over other spatial / temporal / biological scales). Combined with patterns in warming tolerance, this suggests stronger effects on summer communities than winter communities (which may respond more via changes in phenology).
